# ForwardMint: Forward mito-nuclear introgression simualtor

This repository contains code for the simulation of multilocus mito-nuclear introgression following a secondary contact, under a wide range of selective and demographic scenarios.

The name ForwardMint indicates that the core of the simulation is performed forward in time, thus allowing for much flexibility in the biological processes considered. Mint is my way to abbreviate "mito-nuclear introgression". Arguably it is not a very good abbreviation, unless you consider that there may be discordance in introgression.

A previous version of the program is archived at https://github.com/timotheenivalis/CodeAllForward and was used to run simulations for Bonnet, T., Leblois, R., Rousset, F. and Crochet, P.-A. (2017), A reassessment of explanations for discordant introgressions of mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Evolution, 71: 2140-2158. https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.13296. New features and improvements will be implemented here.
